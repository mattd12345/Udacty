<h1>How the World Wide Web works</h1>
<p>The web is a collection of HTML documents,
HTML documents are the main type of document on the web.  Files that can be found on the web are Plain text, HTML, Images, Videos, and music.
The web is made up of the largest computer network on earth. When a user tries to access 
a website such as <a href="www.google.com">Google</a> the server finds the correct <em>HTML</em>
Document to pass to the use's computer via the <b>Web Browser</b> ie. Chrome, IE, Firefox, etc.
</p>

<h2><b>HTML</b></h2>
<p>HTML or <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em> is very important to building
a web page. HTML uses things like <b>Tags, Attributes and Elements</b>
</p>


<b>Tags:</b>
</p>
  HTML is made up of <b>"Tags"</b>.  <B>Tags</B> use "< >" to explain to the 
  computer what to do with certain text. Tags typically have
  an open tag <b>(< Name >)</b> and a closing tag <b>( < / Name >)</b>.  
   
  </p>
  
  <b>Attributes:</b>
  <p> HTML also utilizes Attributes
  Attributes allow you to do such things as link to a picture of <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=i&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CAcQjRw&url=http%3A%2F%2Fotagosh.blogspot.com%2F2015%2F01%2Fstewie-griffin-is-god.html&ei=1BH_VNexJIiSyAT5rYGQCQ&bvm=bv.87611401,d.aWw&psig=AFQjCNHKdUdICS9zOnQ_pA2I7Mq6dS2B3w&ust=1426088791520354">Stewie</a>.
  </p>
  
  <b>Elements:</b>
  <p>
    The whole HTML statement is called an <em>Element</em>. HTML elements can be either inline
    or block. <b>Block</b> elements create an invisible block around the txt where as an
    <b>inline</b> element just ends the line.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Computers and coding</h3>
  <p>Computers are often said to be <em>Stupid</em> and in some sense they are. 
    Computerâ€™s can only do what we <b>tell</b> them to do.  Computers do not yet have 
    the power to know what we are thinking so we need to explain to them what to do on a very basic level, and 
    just like someone from another country, if we want them to do what we tell them to
    we need to speak their language.  <b>HTML</b> is just one of many computer languages
    that we can use to make computers do our bidding!.

  <h4>Key Learnings</h4>
  <p> The two things that that really stuck with me from this lesson are:</p><p><b>1</b>. You cannot know
  everything, learn the basics and the overall concepts and you can find everything
  else you will need.</p></p> <b>2</b>. <em>Anyone</em> can learn <em>anything</em>
    
  </p>
